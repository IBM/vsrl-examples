# Examples
Train a RL agent using Unity3D, Stable Baselines, and the Verifiably Safe Reinforcement Learning framework.

### Repository Structure
* [`EnvBuild`](./EnvBuild): contains the binary files for the Unity environments, as well as their configuration file
* [`hello-world`](./hello_world): use the VSRL framework to load and train a RL agent
* [`unity-simple-examples`](unity-simple-examples): configure, customize, and test the Unity environments provided 
in this repository using Stable Baselines
* [`unity-VSRL-examples`](./unity-VSRL-examples): train and test the VSRL framework with Unity environments
* [`unity-vsrl-trainer`](./unity-vsrl-trainer): the unity project to retrain the ml-agent models. You could retrain the models and check how works the trainer.
